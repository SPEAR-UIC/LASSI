# LASSI: LLM-based Automated Self-correcting pipeline for generating parallel Scientific Codes

***

(Pending: introductory description.)

Please note: The codes generated from the published paper listed below will be included in this repository soon.

Also, we plan to include 'getting started' instructions and will provide an extension of the Notebook to instead run as a command line Python script.
